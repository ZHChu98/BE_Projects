# **K-Coloring**

Project for **Graph Theory**

## **Brief Description**

A k-coloring of a graph G is a vertex coloring that is an assignment of one of k possible colors to each vertex of G (i.e., a vertex coloring) such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. Approaches for K-coloring has been widely applied in real life problems, such as scheduling, register allocation, etc. In this project, our main goal is to evaluate Zykov algorithm with the others on k-coloring problem.

## **Project Structure**

1. Implement several algorithms, such as Brute Force, Leighton, Br√©laz and Zykov
2. Evaluate their performance in difference cases
